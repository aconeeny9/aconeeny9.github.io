            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="info-about">
                <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at Northwestern University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science through the McCormick School of Engineering. I am also pursuing a concentration in Legal Studies.</p>
                <p>On campus I am involved in Spoon University, which is Northwestern's only print and digital food publication, the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and Women in Computing (WIC).</p>
                <p>When I am not completing classwork, I love to spend time with my friends, go hiking, or talk about whatever new book I am reading. I also love baking and have perfected my recipe for maple cinnamon scones.</p>
